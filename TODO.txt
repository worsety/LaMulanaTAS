Future features:
    Patching tool
    Readme
    Sample script
    State indication (field 1C) of drawable objects? May help with AI
    Something for damage boost direction? Got to understand exactly how that works first
Enhancements:
    Display all types of errors in the game window.  Maybe use GDI drawing on the window's DC in IncFrame since that should be between a Present and a Sleep?
    Support non-default key mappings
    Jump preview?
Better uninitialised data hooking: afaics, every object is created through obj_add or obj_add_instantiate, so mod those to set obj->create to an imported function which does its own stuff then obj->create = obj->create2; / *always set to create, purpose unknown */ return obj->create();
    Change input hooking code
        Replace the read_keys kb_enabled check with a call to a tas dll function which overrides kb_enabled only if there is scripted keyboard input that frame
        Replace curinputdev=4 in winproc for key events with a new global which TasIncFrame will copy to curinputdev if it's 4 and there is no scripted input that frame and zero every frame.  Set curdevinputdev=4 if there's scripted keyboard input
Bugs:
    Why does resetting in game after remote shopping desync shops by one frame if you then TAS reset?
