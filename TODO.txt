Future features:
    Patching tool
Enhancements:
    Display all types of errors in the game window.  Maybe use GDI drawing on the window's DC in IncFrame since that should be between a Present and a Sleep?
    Jump preview?
Better uninitialised data hooking: afaics, every object is created through obj_add or obj_add_instantiate, so mod those to set obj->create to an imported function which does its own stuff then obj->create = obj->create2; / *always set to create, purpose unknown */ return obj->create();
    Accurate scrolling collision overlay (optional because it's ugly)
    Preview of screen (1/10 collision map?) for exits display
    Also set boot rng when we first set rng.  Time attack rng can be set at @0 like anything else then
    Object viewer: key to go to top of stack view
    Object viewer: way to track most recently created object in stack view?
Bugs:
    Why does resetting in game after remote shopping desync shops by one frame if you then TAS reset?
