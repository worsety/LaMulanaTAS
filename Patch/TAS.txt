Virtual addresses include the default image base of 0x400000

File	Virtual
000168			Checksum.  This is definitely wrong, I don't even remember patching it
0001b4			Relocation table size
000210			.text virtual size
000238			.rdata virtual size
000260			.data virtual size
0002b0			.reloc virtual size
0536b9	004542b9	read_keys: Replace kb_enabled check with call to TASOnFrame
0536d0	004542d0	read_keys: nop out more kb_enabled code
0536e8	004542e8	read_keys: Change GetKeyState call to TASGetKeyState
05375d	0045435d	read_keys: nop out loop that I think was never used anyway but would be problematic now
0a4c09	004a5809	Wrap call to... composition function pointer? In any case the last function that performs any drawing in a frame with TASRender
0d8ff3	004d9bf3	Change call to sleep function pointer to a wrapper
0d9038	004d9c38	Change call to sleep function pointer to a wrapper
0d9544	004da144	window_deactivated: noped mov byte_DB9343, 0 (background pausing effect)
0d9569	004da169	window_deactivated: noped mov byte_6D4707, 0 (background input?)
0d95cc	004da1cc	Ignore window minimising
0d961c	004da21c	Don't pause on window losing focus
0d988e	004da48e	Change call to an early initialisation function to a wrapper
0fe070	004fec70	black screen transition calculation
			Made a few changes in here, not very pleased about it though
			Basically it was checking if 500ms of real time have passed, but I changed it to the most typical frame count (29?)
2abecb	006acacb	TAS init wrapper
2abf49	006acb49	sleep wrapper

TODO:
Work out why there's some frame variance in field transitions.  Hopefully this is loading frames where input is ineffective (despite being read) even in transition walks and can easily be detected
