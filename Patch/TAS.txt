168fef	569bef	poll_pads: Call XInputGetState wrapper
169005	569c05	poll_pads: Disable vibration on our fake pad
26e5d3	66f1d3	read_pads: Replace unused counter increment with TasIncFrame call

33f1dc		Additions to relocation table

timeGetTime and GetTickCount replacements:
07e6a6	47f2a6	object method call stats (potentially affects object memory for pointer manipulation TASes, but not really)
07e8a1	47f4a1	"
207055	607c55	"
2072b7	607eb7	"
2075d7	6081d7	"
0fd570	4fe170	black screen transition calculation
		Checks for 500ms of real time using a global (so two instances gives us screen mashing)
11d43a	51e03a	msxmenu_update: something to do with emusic I think, song lengths are involved.  Anyway it potentially affects pointerm manipulation TASes, but again not really
11d556	51e156	"
11d684	51e284	"
Other calls shouldn't be able to affect TASes

Known bugs that affect TASing:
Tai Sui's eyes reference the member at offset E8 in Tai Sui on creation... which is before Tai Sui initialises this member so they get the value from whatever last occupied that memory and set it.
Chests use uninitialised memory, haven't analysed how but it affects when they open.
Ghost Lord uses uninitialised memory.
0x53ae40 uses uninitialised memory.
